These latter checks do not show up on the blockchain.\nIt\'s like what the bank thinks your balance is vs what your checkbook knows is actually available because of the checks you\'ve written that are still "in the mail" and not yet cashed.\n\n\n### What determines the number of peers and how to influence their number? Why are there sometimes 300+ peers and sometimes 30?\n\nThe number of connected peers is determined by your node as it attempts to keep the distributed Kademlia well connected.  As nodes come and go in the network your peer count will go up and down. If you watch bee\'s output logs for "successfully connected", there should be a mix of (inbound) and (outbound) at the end of those messages.  If you only get (outbound) then you my need to get your p2p port opened through your firewall and/or forwarded by your router. Check out the connectivity section in the docs https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/connectivity.\n\n\n### What is the difference between "systemctl" and "bee start"?\n\n*bee start* and *systemctl start bee* actually run 2 different instances with 2 different *bee.yaml* files and two different data directories.\n\n*bee start* uses *~/.bee.yaml* and the *~/.bee* directory for data\n*systemctl* uses */etc/bee/bee.yaml* and (IIRC) */var/lib/bee* for data\n\n\n## Swarm Protocol\n\n\n### Can I use one Ethereum Address/Wallet for many nodes?\n\nNo, this violates the requirements of the Swarm Protocol. The Swarm \nProtocol relies upon the `Swarm Address`, also known as the `peer \naddress`. This address is a **hash of the node\'s Ethereum address**, \ntherefore it is deterministic. As all nodes must have a unique address,\nif you were to use the same wallet, it would violate the uniqueness \nconstraint and result in malfunctioning nodes.\n\nTherefore, the rule is, each node must have:\n\n* 1 Ethereum Address\n* 1 Chequebook\n* 3 unique ports for API / p2p / Debug API.\n')))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
